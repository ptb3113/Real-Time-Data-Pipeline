# ðŸ›’ Real-Time Data Pipeline for E-commerce Analytics

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a **real-time data pipeline** tailored for analyzing e-commerce sales data using cutting-edge technologies like **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Amazon S3**. The pipeline is designed to ingest and process real-time sales data, store it for long-term analysis, and provide powerful insights through **monitoring** and **alerting** systems using **Amazon CloudWatch**, **Grafana Cloud**, and **Amazon SNS**.

### âœ¨ Key Features:
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Leverages **Apache Kafka** to handle e-commerce transaction data streams in real-time.
- **Stream Processing:** Utilizes **Apache Spark** to process the streaming data and perform real-time analytics.
- **Data Storage:** Stores processed data in both **PostgreSQL** for fast querying and **Amazon S3** for long-term archival and backup.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implements real-time monitoring using **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Grafana Cloud**, with alerting set up via **Amazon SNS** for system issues or performance thresholds.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Includes **predictive analytics models** to forecast future sales trends and offer insights to optimize business strategies.
